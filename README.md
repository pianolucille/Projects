# Projects

The purpose of this project was simply to experiment with different optimization methods (hill climbing, iterated local search, and a genetic algorithm).

To run the project, first make sure that the .py file is in the same directory as the color.txt file. Also, matplotpib should be installed on your device. Run the .py file via python in a terminal (or in whichever interface you prefer to run python in). It will prompt you accordingly.
